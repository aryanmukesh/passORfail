# passORfail
The project runs on the concept of neural networks (coded in R). It trains the neural network model over a small data, and predicts the output. The premise is, students have taken a mock-test for a main exam and based on their mock_test performance and hours devoted to study, the model predicts whether the student will pass or fail the main exam in future.
